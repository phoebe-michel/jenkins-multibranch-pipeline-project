# jenkins-multibranch-pipeline-project
Sample project with jenkins multibranch pipeline configuration

To set up a basic Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline for your GitHub project, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
1. **Jenkins Installation**: Ensure Jenkins is installed and running.
2. **GitHub Integration**: Confirm that Jenkins has access to your GitHub project, typically by creating a GitHub token and configuring it in Jenkins.
3. **Jenkins Plugins**: Install the required plugins:
   - **Git** and **GitHub Branch Source** plugins (for GitHub integration).
   - **Pipeline plugin** (for Pipeline jobs).
4. **Jenkinsfile**: Prepare a `Jenkinsfile` in your repository's root directory. This file defines the stages of your CI/CD pipeline using the Jenkins Pipeline DSL.
